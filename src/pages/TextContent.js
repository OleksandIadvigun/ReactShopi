         &nbsp;&nbsp; First of all this application used to remind people to buy products they might not have at

         home. There are two options to use it: web version on this site and android application on your

         phone. Or you can use it both, all changes will synchronize very fast, just needed internet

         connection. You can create your own list of some products and shops where you can probably

         buy it. It doesn't matter what kind of products you will add, everyone has own amount

         (how much or how many of something) and the second is expiration date, your should set how

         many days do you need for update its for next time to buy, for example, 5 kg apples with

         expiration 7 days, it means that shopi will remind you to buy it after 7 days, and the second

         thing when shopi detect ( it should be accepted location access for application) that you are

         near the one of the shop from your list, for example, also will sent you a message about it.

         You can also use it when your connection very slowly or it absent, it will synchronize later.

         Just try it and you will be happy to do your purchases in time.
